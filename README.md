# Technology and Communication

I'm a software engineer and API specialist with special interests in open source and writing words about technology.

## Highlights

I'm a published author, check out my titles on [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/5174) and [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/u/lornajane). In between books I blog at <https://lornajane.net>.

I maintain [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) as a member of the Technical Steering Committee. Check out the [main OpenAPI project](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/), the [Overlays project](https://github.com/OAI/Overlay-Specification) and the documentation site [learn.openapis.org](https://learn.openapis.org).

I also maintain [rst2pdf](https://github.com/rst2pdf/rst2pdf); a tool that takes markup and produces presentation PDFs in an instant.

Board member at [OpenUK](https://openuk.uk).
